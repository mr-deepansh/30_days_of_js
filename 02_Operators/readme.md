## Introduction

Operators in JavaScript are symbols or keywords that perform operations on variables and values. They are classified into several types, each serving a specific purpose in manipulating data and controlling program flow.

## Arithmetic Operations

Arithmetic operators perform mathematical calculations on numbers.

- **Addition (+)**: Adds two operands.
- **Subtraction (-)**: Subtracts the second operand from the first.
- **Multiplication (\*)**: Multiplies two operands.
- **Division (/)**: Divides the first operand by the second.
- **Modulus (%)**: Returns the remainder of a division operation.

## Assignment Operators

Assignment operators are used to assign values to variables.

- **+=**: Adds a value to a variable.
- **-=**: Subtracts a value from a variable.
- **\*=**: Multiplies a variable by a value.
- **/=**: Divides a variable by a value.
- **%=**: Assigns the remainder of a division to a variable.

## Comparison Operators

Comparison operators compare two values and return a Boolean result (true or false).

- **>**: Greater than
- **<**: Less than
- **>=**: Greater than or equal to
- **<=**: Less than or equal to
- **==**: Equal to (checks value)
- **===**: Strict equal to (checks value and type)
- **!=**: Not equal to
- **!==**: Strict not equal to

## Logical Operators

Logical operators combine multiple conditions or negate a single condition.

- **&& (Logical AND)**: Returns true if both operands are true.
- **|| (Logical OR)**: Returns true if at least one operand is true.
- **! (Logical NOT)**: Negates the value of a Boolean expression.

## Ternary Operator

The ternary operator (`? :`) is a shorthand for an if-else statement. It evaluates a condition and returns one of two values depending on whether the condition is true or false.

## Achievement

By understanding and mastering operators in JavaScript, you will:

- Perform basic to advanced mathematical operations on data.
- Modify variable values efficiently using assignment operators.
- Compare values accurately using comparison operators.
- Combine conditions effectively using logical operators.
- Write concise conditional expressions using the ternary operator.
