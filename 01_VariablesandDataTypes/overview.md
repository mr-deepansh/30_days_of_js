## Variable Declaration

In JavaScript, variables can be declared using `var`, `let`, or `const`.

- `var` is function-scoped and can be redeclared.
- `let` is block-scoped and cannot be redeclared.
- `const` is block-scoped and cannot be reassigned.

## Constant Declaration

Constants are declared using the `const` keyword. Once assigned, their values cannot be changed.

## Data Types

JavaScript supports various data types including strings, numbers, booleans, objects, arrays, null, and undefined.

## Reassigning Variables

Variables declared with `let` can be reassigned to a new value, while variables declared with `const` cannot be reassigned.

## Understanding `const`

Variables declared with `const` cannot be reassigned. Attempting to do so will result in an error.

## Conclusion

This repository provides a basic introduction to variable declarations, data types, and constants in JavaScript. Understanding these concepts is essential for writing robust and maintainable JavaScript code.
